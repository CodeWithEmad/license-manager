WARNING: THIS DOCUMENT IS A PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME, NONE OF THESE EVENTS ARE IMPLEMENTED YET IN THE CODE BASE.

Segment events
==============

``license-manager`` emits several Segment events of the format:

``edx.server.license-manager.license-lifecycle.<new-status>``


Possible values of the **new status** event name match the subscriptions.License lifecycle. Events are emitted when a new ``subscriptions.License`` record's ``status`` field changes from a previous value or if other data on the record is updated as detailed below: 

edx.server.license-manager.license-lifecycle.created
-----------------------------------------------------
Emitted when a ``subscriptions.License`` model with a new UUID is created

edx.server.license-manager.license-lifecycle.assigned
------------------------------------------------------
Emitted when a ``subscriptions.License`` model is assigned to a specific email address.

This event may be emitted multiple times per license if a license is re-used by an Enterprise.

The user_id field for this event will contain the user_id of the user who performed the assignment.

edx.server.license-manager.license-lifecycle.revoked
-----------------------------------------------------
Emitted when a ``subscriptions.License`` model is revoked from a specific email address.

This event may be emitted multiple times per license if a license is re-used by an Enterprise.

The user_id field for this event will contain the user_id of the user who performed the revocation.


edx.server.license-manager.license-lifecycle.activated
-------------------------------------------------------
Emitted when an assigned ``subscriptions.License`` model is activated.

Activation refers to the high level process of a learner acknowledging a license has been assigned to them and then using an edX learner account that is linked to this license. 

This event may be emitted multiple times per license if a license is re-used by an Enterprise.


edx.server.license-manager.license-lifecycle.renewed
-----------------------------------------------------
Emitted when an existing ``subscriptions.License`` is replaced with a new ``subscriptions.License``. Renewed licenses do not necessarily have to have an assigned learner.

The license_uuid field for this event contains the new license generated by the renewal process. 

The previous_license_uuid field for this event contains the license that is being replaced as part of the renewal event.


edx.server.license-manager.license-lifecycle.expired
-----------------------------------------------------
Emitted when an existing ``subscriptions.License`` is marked as expired.
